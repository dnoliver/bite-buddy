# Voice Assistants

## Step 1 - Describe the Application

The selected use case is a Voice Assistant that allows you to dictate products
present in different parts of your kitchen (for example in the pantry, in the
fridge), and maintain an inventory of them. At a later time, you can query the
assistant for items present in the inventory, for example: while doing grocery
shopping, I can ask if there is already mayonnaise at home. BiteBuddy allows you
to do Inventory Management of your kitchen.

The features supported by the application are:

- Use the microphone to send requests to the assistant.
- Record a product in a specific kitchen location.
- Ask what items are present in a particular kitchen location.
- Inquire about the location of a specific product.
- Remove items stored in a specific kitchen location.
- Generate a meal recipe with the products currently available in the kitchen.

## Step 2 - Interaction Model

The voice assistant implements the following intents to handle user requests:

- **InventoryEntryIntent:** This intent is used to add an item to the inventory.
- **InventoryQueryIntent:** This intent is used to query the inventory products
  in a given location.
- **ProductQueryIntent:** This intent is used to find a product in the
  inventory.
- **InventoryDeleteIntent:** This intent is used to remove an item from the
  inventory.
- **RecipeQueryIntent:** This intent is used to recommend a recipe based on a
  list of products.

## Step 3 - Fulfillment

This is the fulfillment logic for the InventoryEntryIntent:

```txt
<!-- InventoryEntryIntentHandling -->

Function run(utterance: string):
  Parse the location in the kitchen from the utterance
  Parse the list of products from the utterance

  For each product in the parsed product list:
    Insert the product into the specified location

  Return a message confirming the products have been added
  to the specified location
```

This is the fulfillment logic for the InventoryQueryIntent:

```txt
<!-- InventoryQueryIntentHandling -->

Function run(utterance: string):
  Get the location in the kitchen from the utterance

  If the location is "kitchen":
    Get the list of all products
  Else:
    Get the list of products from the specified location

  If there are no products in the specified location:
    Return a message indicating no products are found

  Return a message listing the products found
```

This is the fulfillment logic for the ProductQueryIntent:

```txt
<!-- ProductQueryIntentHandling -->

Function run(utterance: string):
  Parse the product from the utterance
```

This is the fullfilment logic for the ProductQueryIntent:

```txt
<!-- ProductQueryIntentHandling -->

Function run(utterance: str):
    Parse the product from the utterance
    Find the locations of product

    If the product was not found in any location:
        Return a message indicating the product is not found
    If the product was found in one location:
        Return a message indicating the product is found in
        a single location
    If the product was found in several locations:
        Return a message indicating the product is found in
        multiple locations
```

This is the fullfilment logic for the InventoryDeleteIntent:

```txt
<!-- InventoryDeleteIntentHandling -->

Function run(utterance: str):
    Parse the location in the kitchen from the utterance
    Delete all products from the specified location

    Return a message confirming the specified location
    has been cleared
```

This is the fullfilment logic for the RecipeQueryIntent:

```txt
<!-- RecipeQueryIntentHandling -->

Function run(utterance: str):
    Get the list of all products in the inventory

    If there are no products:
        Return a message indicating there are no products in the kitchen

    Genearte a prompt for an LLM requesting it to
    generate a recipe based on the products available

    Make the request to the LLM

    Return a message with the recipe generated by the LLM
```

## Step 4 - Persona

Regarding the personality of the Voice Assistant, the name is Marcelo. He is an
adult person who speaks English with a some foreign accent. He is energetic, he
wants to get stuff done fast and efficient, considers doing chores as a waste of
time and something that just needs to be done, but also wants to do them well.
He likes eating healthy and diverse, but he is not a "foodie".
