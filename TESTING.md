# Test Plan

This is a test plan for the Bite Buddy Voice Assistant application.

## Purpose

The purpose is to do a Task test: can users complete a certain task?

## Problem statement -> what's the objective

The objective of this activity is to verify if the user can use the application
to achieve a given task. We want to know if the application will help maintain
your kitchen inventory in a way that is more convenient than plain note taking
(e.g with pencil and paper, or in another app).

## User profile -> who is the user?

- General computer experience: The user is a digital native, has a fair
  understanding of computing technology, uses a cellphone every day for common
  tasks, and usually has access to a computer for more dedicated tasks (e.g 1
  hour every other day)
- Age: 25 to 45 years old
- Education: High School, have attended some College
- Major: Business and Management, Social Sciences.
- General interests: Technology and Gadgets, Social Media, Fitness and Wellness.

## Test design

The user will be instructed to complete the following tasks:

- Use Bite Buddy to dictate the products currently in your fridge.
- Command Bite Buddy to speak out the products currently in your fridge.
- Command Bite Buddy to forget the products in your fridge.

If the user can't execute the task, the tester shall provide additional
information about how to do it. This shall be done after 3 attempts, to prevent
interfiering with the testing process and to prevent frustruation from the user.

After completing the tasks, the user wil be instructed to complete the following
survey, using the Likert Scale to rate engagement level:

| Statement                                      | Strongly Disagree | Disagree | Somewhat Disagree | Neutral | Somewhat Agree | Agree | Strongly Agree |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | -------- | ----------------- | ------- | -------------- | ----- | -------------- |
| The application is easy to use                 |                   |          |                   |         |                |       |                |
| I like the flow of the application             |                   |          |                   |         |                |       |                |
| The application understands what I say         |                   |          |                   |         |                |       |                |
| I would recommend this application to a friend |                   |          |                   |         |                |       |                |

Finally, an open interview with the user based on what was observed during the
testing session will be conducted. The questions and answers will be documented
for further analysis

## Reports

For every testing session, a report will be presented with the following:

1. Task completion rates
1. Completed survey
1. Notes from the final interview
